# places fo' yo' FACESSSSSSS

//can i push the review id and string to the place?

//when deleting a place, delete reviews about that place
//subdocument = address of place?

//security, headers, authentication, jwt, helmet, cors






/users
update- by adding a favorite place, which adds a place to user's favorites and adds them to the place's favorite_user's list.

/places
create- address as an array
read-get by name

/reviews
create- with a timestamp, appends to user and place

deleting was probably the most annoying to me.
